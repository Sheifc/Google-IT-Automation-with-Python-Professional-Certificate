## Quiz: Recursion: Grade 100%

### 1. What is recursion used for?

• Recursion is used to call a function from inside the same function.

You nailed it! By reducing the problem to a smaller one each time 
a recursive function is called, we can tackle complex problems in simple steps.

### 2. Which of these activities are good use cases for recursive programs? 
Check all that apply.

• Going through a file system collecting information related to directories and files.

Right on! Because directories can contain subdirectories that can contain 
more subdirectories, going through these contents is a good use case for a 
recursive program.

• Managing permissions assigned to groups inside a company, when each group 
can contain both subgroups and users.

Correct. As the groups can contain both groups and users, 
this is the kind of problem that is a great use case for a recursive solution.

### 3. Fill in the blanks to make the is_power_of function return whether the number is a power of the given base. 
Note: base is assumed to be a positive number. 
Tip: for tunctions that return a boolean value. 
You can return the result ot a comparison.
~~~
def is_power_of(number, base):
    # Base case: when number is smaller than base.
    if number < base:
        # If number is equal to 1, it's a power (base**0).
        return number == 1

    # Recursive case: keep dividing number by base.
    return is_power_of(number // base, base)

print(is_power_of(8,2)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of(64,4)) # Should be True
print(is_power_of(70,10)) # Should be False

Output:
True
True
False
~~~

### 4. The count_users function recursively counts the amount of users that belongs to a group in the company system,by going through each of the members of a group and if one of them is a group, recursively calling the function and counting the members. But it has a bug! Can you spot the problem and fix it?

~~~
def count_users(group):
  count = 0
  for member in get_members(group):
    count += 1
    if is_group(member):
      count += count_users(member)-1 #means that the one one assumed member that turned out 
                         #to be a group just needs to be eliminated from the count variable.
  return count 

print(count_users("sales")) # Should be 3
print(count_users("engineering")) # Should be 8
print(count_users("everyone")) # Should be 18
~~~

Explanation step by step:  
• Initialize a variable count to 0. This variable will be used to keep track 
of the number of users.  
• Loop through each member in the group using the get_members(group) function. 
This function is assumed to return a list of members within the given group.  
• Increment the count by 1 for each member encountered. This step counts the 
current member, which could be an individual user or a subgroup.  
• Check if the current member (member) is a group using the is_group(member) 
function. If it is a group, you recursively call the count_users function on 
that subgroup. When doing this, you subtract 1 from the result before adding 
it to the count.  
• The subtraction of 1 is an adjustment to avoid double-counting the subgroup 
itself. Since you've already incremented the count by 1 when you initially 
encountered the subgroup in the loop, you need to subtract 1 to avoid 
counting it again when counting its members.
Continue this process for each member in the group, recursively counting 
the users within subgroups and individual users.  
• Finally, return the total count, which represents the total number of 
users within the given group, including subgroups and individual users.

### 5. Implement the sum_positive_numbers function, as a recursive function that returns the sum of all positive numbers between the number n received and 1. 
For example, when n is 3 it should return 1+2+3=6, and when n is 5 
it should return 1+2+3+4+5=15.
~~~
def sum_positive_numbers(n):
  if n == 1:
    return 1
  else: 
    return n + sum_positive_numbers(n-1)

print(sum_positive_numbers(3)) # Should be 6
print(sum_positive_numbers(5)) # Should be 15

Output:
6
15
