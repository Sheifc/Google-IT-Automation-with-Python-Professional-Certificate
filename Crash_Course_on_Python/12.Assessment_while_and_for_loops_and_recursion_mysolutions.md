## Assessment 1: While loops, for loops and recursion: Grade 100%

### 1. Fill in the blanks to print the even numbers from 2 to 12.
~~~~
number = 2 # Initialize the variable 
while number < 13 and number % 2 == 0: # Complete the while loop condition
    print(number, end=" ")
    number += 2 # Increment the variable

# Should print 2 4 6 8 10 12 

Output: 2 4 6 8 10 12
~~~~

### 2. Find and correct the error in the for loop below. The loop should check each number from 1 to 5 and identify if the number is odd or even.
~~~~
for number in range(1,6):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")


# Should print:
# odd
# even
# odd
# even
# odd

Output: 
odd
even
odd
even
odd
~~~~

### 3. Fill in the blanks to complete the "factorial" function. This function will accept an integer variable "n" through the function parameters and produce the factorials of this number (by multiplying this value by every number less than the original number [n* (n-1)], excluding 0). To do this, the function should:
accept an integer variable "n" through the function parameters; initialize a variable "result" to the value of the "n" variable;
iterate over the values of "n" using a while loop until "n" is equal to O;
starting at n-1, multiply the result by the current "n" value;
decrement "n" by -1.
For example, tactorial 3 would return the value ot 3 2 1, which would be 6
~~~~
def factorial(n):
    result = n
    start = n
    n -= 1
    while n > 0: # The while loop should execute as long as n is greater than 0
        result *= n # Multiply the current result by the current value of n
        n -= 1 # Decrement the appropriate variable by -1
    return result


print(factorial(3)) # Should print 6
print(factorial(9)) # Should print 362880
print(factorial(1)) # Should print 1

Output: 
6
362880
1
~~~~

### 4. Fill in the blanks to complete the "sequence" function. This function should print a sequence of numbers in descending order, from the given "high" variable to the given "low" variable. The range should make the loop run two times. Complete the range sequences in the nested loops so that the "sequence(1, 3)" function call prints the following:
3, 2, 1  
3, 2, 1
~~~~
def sequence(low, high):
    # Complete the outer loop range to make the loop run twice
    # to create two rows
    for x in range(2): 
        # Complete the inner loop range to print the given variable
        # numbers starting from "high" to "low" 
        # Hint: To decrement a range parameter, use negative numbers
        for y in range(high, low -1, -1): 
            if y == low:
                # Don’t print a comma after the last item
                print(str(y)) 
            else:
                # Print a comma and a space between numbers
                print(str(y), end=", ") 

sequence(1, 3)
# Should print the sequence 3, 2, 1 two times, as shown above.

Output: 
3, 2, 1
3, 2, 1
~~~~

### 5. Fill in the blanks to complete the "divisible" function. This function should count the number of values from O to the "max" parameter that are evenly divisible (no remainder) by the "divisor" parameter. Complete the code so that a function call like "divisible(100,10)" will return the number "10°.
~~~~
def divisible(max, divisor):
    count = 0 # Initialize an incremental variable
    for x in range(0, max): # Complete the for loop
        if x % divisor == 0:
            count += 1 # Increment the appropriate variable
    return count

print(divisible(100, 10)) # Should be 10
print(divisible(10, 3)) # Should be 4
print(divisible(144, 17)) # Should be 9

Output: 
10
4
9
~~~~

### 6. Fill in the blanks to complete the "odd _numbers" function. This function should return a space-separated string of all odd positive numbers, up to and including the "maximum" variable that's passed into the function. Complete the for loop so that a function call like "odd_numbers(6)" will return the numbers "135".
~~~
def odd_numbers(maximum):
    
    return_string = "" # Initializes variable as a string

    # Complete the for loop with a range that includes all 
    # odd numbers up to and including the "maximum" value.
    if maximum <= 0:
        return_string += "No numbers displayed"

    for maximum in range(1, maximum + 1, 2): 
        # Complete the body of the loop by appending the odd number
        # followed by a space to the "return_string" variable.
        return_string += str(maximum) + " "

    # This .strip command will remove the final " " space 
    # at the end of the "return_string".
    return return_string.strip()


print(odd_numbers(6))  # Should be 1 3 5
print(odd_numbers(10)) # Should be 1 3 5 7 9
print(odd_numbers(1))  # Should be 1
print(odd_numbers(3))  # Should be 1 3
print(odd_numbers(0))  # No numbers displayed

Output: 
1 3 5
1 3 5 7 9
1
1 3
No numbers displayed
~~~

### 10. The following code causes an infinite loop. Can you figure out what's incorrect and how to fix it?
~~~~
def count_to_ten():
  # Loop through the numbers from first to last 
  x = 1
  while x <= 10:
    print(x)
    x = 1

count_to_ten()

# Should print:
# 1
# 2
# 3 
# 4
# 5

### 6. Fill in the blanks to complete the "all_numbers" function. This function should return a space-separated string of all numbers, from the starting "minimum" variable up to and including the "maximum" variable that's passed into the function. Complete the for loop so that a function call like "all _numbers(3,6)" will return the uers "3 5 6"
~~~
def all_numbers(minimum, maximum):

    return_string = "" # Initializes variable as a string

    # Complete the for loop with a range that includes all 
    # numbers up to and including the "maximum" value.
    for num in range(minimum, maximum + 1): 

        # Complete the body of the loop by appending the number
        # followed by a space to the "return_string" variable.
        return_string += str(num) + " " 

    # This .strip command will remove the final " " space 
    # at the end of the "return_string".
    return return_string.strip()


print(all_numbers(2,6))  # Should be 2 3 4 5 6
print(all_numbers(3,10)) # Should be 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
print(all_numbers(-1,1)) # Should be -1 0 1
print(all_numbers(0,5))  # Should be 0 1 2 3 4 5
print(all_numbers(0,0))  # Should be 0
