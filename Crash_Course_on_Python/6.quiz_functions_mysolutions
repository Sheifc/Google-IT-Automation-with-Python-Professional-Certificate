# Quiz: Functions: Grade 100%

1. This function converts miles to kilometers (km).
Complete the code to return the result of the conversion.
NOTE: The following items occur outside of the function. Do not try to change the 
indentations on the associated code or you will receive an error.
Call the function to convert the trip distance from miles to kilometers.
Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion.
Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result, and fill in the 
blank to print the result.

# Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6  # approximately 1.6 km in 1 mile
	return km

# Do not indent any of the following lines of code as they are 
# meant to be located outside of the function above

my_trip_miles = 55

# Convert my_trip_miles to kilometers by calling the function above
my_trip_km = convert_distance(my_trip_miles)

# Fill in the blank to print the result of the my_trip_km conversion
print("The distance in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km))

# Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result of
#    my_trip_km. Fill in the blank to print the result.
print("The round-trip in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km*2))

Output: 
The distance in kilometers is 88.0
The round-trip in kilometers is 176.0

2. This function compares two numbers and returns them in increasing order.
Fill in the blanks, so the print statement displays the result of the function 
call in order.
Hint: if a function returns multiple values, don't forget to store these values 
in multiple variables

# This function compares two numbers and returns them
# in increasing order.
def order_numbers(number1, number2):
	if number2 > number1:
		return number1, number2
	else:
		return number2, number1

# Fill in the blanks so the print statement displays the result
#    of the function call
smaller, bigger = order_numbers(100, 99)
print(smaller, bigger)

Output: 99 100

3. What are the values passed into functions as input called?

Answer: Parameters 

Correct. A parameter, also sometimes called an argument, is a value passed 
into a function for use within the function.

4. Complete the first line of the "print_seconds" function so that it accepts three 
parameters: hours, minutes, and seconds. Remember to use the "def" keyword
to tell the Python interpreter the block ot code is intended to detine a function

def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    print(hours*3600+minutes*60+seconds)


print_seconds(1,2,3)
#output will print to the screen

Output:
3723

Correct. The formula should multiply the hours variable by
3600 and the minutes variable by 60, then add these two
products to the seconds variable.

5. What is the purpose of the def keyword?

Answer: Used to define a new function

Correct. When defining a new function, we must use the def keyword followed by 
the function name and properly indented body.
