### 1. Complete the code to output the statement, "Diego's favorite food is lasagna". 
Remember that precise syntax must be used to receive credit.
~~~
name = "Diego"
fav_food = "lasagna"
print(name + "’s favorite food is " + fav_food) 
~~~

### 2. What's the value of this Python expression: "big" > "small"?

`Answer`: False

### 3. What is the elif keyword used for?

`Answer`: To handle more than two comparison cases

### 4. Consider the following scenario about using if-elif-else statements:

Students in a class receive their grades as Pass/Fail. Scores of 60 or 
more (out of 100) mean that the grade is "Pass". For lower scores, the grade is 
"Fail". In addition, scores above 95 (not included) are graded as "Top Score.
Fill in the blanks in this function so that it returns the appropriate "Pass", 
"Fail", or "Top Score" grade.
~~~
def exam_grade(score):
    if score > 95:
        grade = "Top Score"
    elif score >= 60 and score <= 95:
        grade = "Pass"
    else:
        grade = "Fail"
    return grade


print(exam_grade(65)) # Should print Pass
print(exam_grade(55)) # Should print Fail
print(exam_grade(60)) # Should print Pass
print(exam_grade(95)) # Should print Pass
print(exam_grade(100)) # Should print Top Score
print(exam_grade(0)) # Should print Fail
~~~
Output: 
Pass
Fail
Pass
Pass
Top Score
Fail

### 5. What's the value of the comparison in this if statement? 
Hint: The answer is not what the code will print.
~~~
n = 4
if n*6 > n**2 or n%2 == 0:
    print("Check")
~~~
`Answer`: True

### 6. Fill in the blanks to complete the function. 
The "complementary_color" function receives a primary color name in all lower case, 
then prints its complementary color.
Currently, the function only supports the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue. 
It returns "unknown" for all other colors or if the word has any uppercase characters.
~~~
def complementary_color(color):
    if color == "blue":
        complement = "orange"
    elif color == "yellow":
        complement = "purple"
    elif color == "red":
        complement = "green"
    else:
        complement = "unknown"
    return complement

print(complementary_color("blue")) # Should print orange
print(complementary_color("yellow")) # Should print purple
print(complementary_color("red")) # Should print green
print(complementary_color("black")) # Should print unknown
print(complementary_color("Blue")) # Should print unknown
print(complementary_color("")) # Should print unknown
~~~
Output: 
orange
purple
green
unknown
unknown
unknown

### 7. Can you calculate the output of this code?
~~~
def difference(x, y):
    z = x - y
    return z

print(difference(5, 3))
~~~
Answer: 2

### 8. What's the value of this Python expression?
~~~
× = 5*2
((10 != ×) or (10 > x))
~~~
Answer: False

### 9. Fill in the blanks to complete the function. 
The fractional_part function divides the numerator by the denominator, 
and returns just the fractional part (a number between 0 and 1). 
Complete the body of the function so that it returns the right number. 
Note: Since division by 0 produces an error, if the denominator 
is 0, the function should return 0 instead of attempting the division.
~~~
def fractional_part(numerator, denominator):
    # Operate with numerator and denominator to
    # keep just the fractional part of the quotient 
    if denominator == 0 or numerator == 0 or numerator/denominator == 0 :
        part = 0
    else:
        part = (numerator % denominator)/ denominator
    return part


print(fractional_part(5, 5)) # Should print 0
print(fractional_part(5, 4)) # Should print 0.25
print(fractional_part(5, 3)) # Should print 0.66...
print(fractional_part(5, 2)) # Should print 0.5
print(fractional_part(5, 0)) # Should print 0
print(fractional_part(0, 5)) # Should print 0
~~~
Output: 
0.0
0.25
0.6666666666666666
0.5
0
0

### 10. What are some of the benefits of good code style? Select all that apply.

`Answers`: 
Easier to maintain
Makes the intent of the code obvious

## Assessment 1: Expressions, Variables, functions and Conditionals: Grade 100% 

### 1. Complete the code to output the statement, 
"Marjery lives at her home address of 1234 Mockingbird Lane". 
Remember that precise syntax must be used to receive credit.
~~~
name = "Marjery"
home_address = "1234 Mockingbird Lane"
print(name + " lives at her home address of " + home_address)
# Should print "Marjery lives at her home address of 1234 Mockingbird Lane"
~~~
Output:
Marjery lives at her home address of 1234 Mockingbird Lane

### 2. same

### 3. What directly follows the elif keyword in an elif statement?

`Answer`: A comparison

### 4. same

### 5. When using an if statement, the code inside the if block will only execute if the 
conditional statement returns what?

`Answer`: True

### 6. Fill in the blanks to complete the function. 
The "identify_IP" function receives an "P_address" as a string through 
the function's parameters, then it should print a description of the IP address. 
Currently, the function should only support three IP addresses and return 
"unknown" for all other IPs.
~~~
def identify_IP(IP_address):
    if IP_address == "192.168.1.1":
        IP_description = "Network router"
    elif IP_address == "8.8.8.8" or IP_address == "8.8.4.4":
        IP_description = "Google DNS server"
    elif IP_address == "142.250.191.46":
        IP_description = "Google.com"
    else:
        IP_description = "unknown"
    return IP_description


print(identify_IP("8.8.4.4")) # Should print 'Google DNS server'
print(identify_IP("142.250.191.46")) # Should print 'Google.com'
print(identify_IP("192.168.1.1")) # Should print 'Network router'
print(identify_IP("8.8.8.8")) # Should print 'Google DNS server'
print(identify_IP("10.10.10.10")) # Should print 'unknown'
print(identify_IP("")) # Should Should print 'unknown'
~~~
Output: 
Google DNS server
Google.com
Network router
Google DNS server
unknown
unknown

### 7. same

### 8. What's the value of this Python expression?
~~~
((10 >= 5*2) and (10 <= 5*2))
~~~
`Answer`: True

### 9. Fill in the blanks to complete the function. 
The "make_positive" function takes in a number and converts that number 
to its positive equivalent. 
Complete the function to accomplish the following tasks:
use an if statement to test if the number is negative;
use a calculation inside the it statement to change the negative number to be 
positive;
use a calculation in the else statement to return any positive "number" unchanged.
~~~
def make_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        result = number * -1 
    else:
        result = number
    return result


print(make_positive(-4))   # Should print 4
print(make_positive(0))    # Should print 0
print(make_positive(-.25)) # Should print 0.25
print(make_positive(5))    # Should print 5
~~~
Output:
4
0
0.25
5
